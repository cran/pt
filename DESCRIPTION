Description: Implements (cumulative) prospect theory and other
    theories of risky decision making. A practically unlimited number of
    choices can be specified. The package allows for different probability
    weighting functions and utility functions to be specified, as well as their
    parameters. Other features include the ability to plot individual
    probability weighting curves and families of these curves, as well as
    individual utility function curves. Single-stage decision trees can be
    drawn. The probability simplex can also be drawn. Certainty equivalents and
    risk premiums can be plotted. Theoretical predictions for different risky
    decision making theories can be compared against each other and empirical
    data.
